Instructions
Create a Project Using create-react-app
Start by setting up a new React project:

npx create-react-app my-class-component-app
cd my-class-component-app

Transform App.js into a Class-Based Component
Modify the App.js file to use a class-based component. Implement state to manage a person's profile and a boolean to toggle visibility.

 Implement the State
Define a state in your class-based component with the following structure:

Person: An object containing:
fullName: The full name of the person.
bio: A short biography.
imgSrc: A URL for the person's image.
profession: The profession of the person.
shows: A boolean to toggle the visibility of the person's profile.


Add a Toggle Button
Include a button that toggles the shows state. When shows is true, the person's profile should be visible.

Show Time Interval Since Last Mount
Create a field that displays the time interval since the component was last mounted. Use the setInterval method to update this field periodically.

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.
